# The-Pomodoro-Project

A simple Pomodoro Technique timer implemented in Python using Tkinter.

## Description

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. After four intervals, a longer break of 20 minutes is taken.

This project implements the Pomodoro Technique timer with the following intervals:
- 25 minutes of work
- 5 minutes break
- After 4 repetitions, a 20-minute long break is given.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Countdown timers for work and break periods.
- Visual and audio notifications at the end of each interval.
- Tracks the number of completed work intervals.
- Start and Reset buttons to control the timer.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/vishwajeet-yaduraj/The-Pomodoro-Project.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd The-Pomodoro-Project

3. Run the Python script:

python main.py


4. The timer interface will appear. 
   - Click on the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro session.
   - Click on the "Reset" button to restart the Pomodoro session.

5. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four work intervals, a 20-minute long break will be automatically started.

6. Click on the "Reset" button to restart the Pomodoro session.
